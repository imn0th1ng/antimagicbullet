# PAC-AntiMagicBullet


WARNING (Thanks for the pmpy to reporting this vulnerability.)
Just a heads-up but the way you have this script setup can be exploited by any lua executor and just mass ban your players on the server by using the pac:magicbullet event you have setup in your main.lua file thatâ€™s on the server-side.

Players can easily make a for loop in a lua executor to loop through 1-X numbers and ban any players online on the server.

A simple client-side dump by a cheater with a half decent brain will find this and most likely try to exploit it.
